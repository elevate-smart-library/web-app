**[Toronto Smart Library Project](https://github.com/elevate-smart-library)** is a complete solution to bring literature in Toronto into the next generation of tech. With a mobile app and exciting new ways for customers to find, checkout and donate books, our project also includes a web dashboard for admin purposes which will track inventory, customer usage and other important data that will give TSL the ability to keep track of everything.
