				"Library_Story__c": "Nesbitt Park is the gathering point for the community known as Governors Bridge in mid-town Toronto. The concept of a little free library is consistent with the community feel of this park and so in the fall of 2013, an initiative was launched to obtain City permission to install it and obtain and decorate the library itself. Chris Fraser organized logistics of municipal approvals and spear-headed public relations. Bill Wrigley, a well-known champion of little free libraries in the Greater Toronto Area built the box. Jacqueline Jordan stenciled ferns and literary quotations all over the library and organized the kick-off. The little free library, branch # 1832, was officially launched on January 21, 2014 in -30 degree Celsius (-22 F) weather which was tempered by a donation of hot chocolate by the manager of Tim Hortons (1840 Bayview Ave). The launch took place, not long after sunrise around 8:15 am to coincide with gathering for the \"walking school bus\". The park is the weekday morning meeting point where local school children are dropped off by parents and then walk together with designated adults on the \"walking school bus\" the rest of the way up to Bennington Heights Elementary School. Also, at the park, a community picnic takes place every September- dads wheel their barbeques up the street and everyone donates food (odd number houses donate desserts and even numbered houses donate salads). Games take place and a good time is had by all. In the winter, local parents put up and maintain a rink so the children can skate outside for a couple of months. Nesbitt Park is the Governors Bridge \"town square\" and how appropriate to have a library in the centre of town.",
